Title: Refined Moderation Analysis with binary outcomes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eric Anto
Maintainer: Eric Anto <eric.anto@utah.edu>
Description: This package employs the symmetry property concerning the ratio of odds ratios, which suggests that both the    main treatment and the heterogeneous treatment effects could
  be equivalently estimated via a role exchange between the outcome and treatment variable in logistic regression
  models. Refined inference on moderating effects is obtained by rearranging data and combing two models into
  one via a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach.
